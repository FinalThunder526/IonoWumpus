6-4-12-1: First backup - from scare, we almost lost every friggin' file. Don't want that to happen again.
- Room to room movement buggy: sometimes even a room is translated as a chamber
- Wumpus isn't in the center
- "Wumpus can't be in a chamber" - still needs to be implemented

6-4-12-2: Backup, after SJ debugging with help
- Room to room mvmt bug fixed
- Wumpus in the center
- Wumpus can't be in a chamber seems to be fixed, let's see.
- Player and Wumpus starting positions randomization - successfully implemented
- MAYDAY MAYDAY: TRIVIA I CAN'T FIND YOUR ALG/CHEM Q/A TXT FILES! THEY SHOULD BE UNDER \WumpusTest\WumpusTest\bin\x86\Debug\algTriviaQuestions.txt
AT THE MOMENT THEY ARE ONLY PLACEHOLDERS!! YOU DO HAVE BACKUPS RIGHT!?!??

6-5-12:
- Wumpus can't be in a chamber - to be fixed
